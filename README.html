<p>This repository/web page of pages is a personal &#8220;home&#8221; for me. For lots of people this means a portfolio of their work and resume but for me it&#8217;s much more of a sandbox. I build lots of random stuff whenever I feel like it and that stuff then gets forgotten about because I don&#8217;t give it a home to live. This is going to be that place although it is not yet hosted anywhere. </p>
